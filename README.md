# Illuminated-64-logo
This is a 3D printed illuminated (Commodore) 64 Logo. It is meant to be used in Commodore C64 projects and is considered a fan art. A commecial use might be resticted by copyrights of a thrid party. Use is on your own risk, I am not liable for that.

There are two versions for the logo. One is all parts being printed separately.

Another version is for being printed on multi-filament printers.

The (clear) illuminated body acts as a diffusor and should be printed with 100% infill. 

The LEDs can be connected to a PCB, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/Illuminated-Commmodore-logo/tree/master/C-logo_illuminated/PCB/Rev.%200">here</a>.

A small perfboard, which holds the LED and teh current mimiting resistors also works fine.
